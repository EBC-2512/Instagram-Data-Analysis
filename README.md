# Instagram Usage Analysis

## Description

## Motivation
Every day Ä± spend at least 2 to 3 hours on Instagram. I know that is a very big amount of time for just considering as a spare time.So i thought to myself there should be at least some information that i gather from instagram and not just trashing my time. To understand this i decided to begin this project. First i downloaded my instagram data from the instagram page and i saw there are some densities of usage at certain times. Than i researched that dense areas at that specific hours and came up with a conclusion: "In certain hours of days i use social media to relax while in other certain hours i use it for fun." This was all theory until i started this project to make detailed data research.

## Tools
Jupyter Notebook: Used for coding and documentation.
Pandas: Used for data cleaning, filtering, and structuring.
Altair: Mainly employed for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and interactive visualizations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Supplementary for visualizations if needed.
Numpy: Used for mathematical operations.
Scipy: Used for statistical analysis.
distfit Used for distribution fitting.

## Data Source
My main data source is directly exported from Instagram as a personal data request. Since i did not need anything to complete my research i didn't look for any other data source. You can see the raw data from rdata folder.
In the requested data i had ,liked contents and comments on instagram with the login data.

## Data Processing
Data given to me had url,title name,time stamp and the value number on them so i had to seperate the title name and time stamp from them. I also stripped the value and url from the raw data too.
